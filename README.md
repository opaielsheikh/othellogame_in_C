i first implemented two struct, 
The first struct i made is called player which will contain each player name colour disc and their score for the game.
The second struct i made is called the board which will contain the board rows and columns and the flips index for the discs,
I initialised the first struct by asking the two players to enter each of their name and ask the first player what colour the first player
want, than initialise the second player with the other colour.
i set the score to 2 for each player as its the start of the game.

Then i initialised the second struct that will contain the board
